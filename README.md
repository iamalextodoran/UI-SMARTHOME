## Hustle for:
- better routes (stackoverflow could help)
- fix temperture modes
- in rooms, edit mode for each room
- in devices each device type have to be grouped by each room (ie lights has big room with 3 lights, small rooms with 2 lights, and guest room with one light)

- leave home exactly the same, but use rooms for displaying each room (+ a menu for rooms to display each existing room)

- primary and accent color
- dark mode with local storage
- mobile, tablet and desktop responsive
- toggle has to be modular

- how to react and rails 

- make a modular modal just like you did with toasts
